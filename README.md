#### Generate Custom Counting Sequences Using For Loops
#### _**by Suzi Rubino â€” August 18th, 2019**_
<br>

## Description
Website with script and form that takes two numbers - one to count to and another to determine what multiple to use to get there.

Here is some sample input:
Count to: 30
Count by: 5
Output: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30

Count to: 50
Count by: 7
Output: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49

Form and script handles:

empty values (user just presses enter) with required html validator
non-numeric values with html input type = number
negative numbers by setting the minimum value of the input to 1
count by number is larger than the count to numbers with if statement in for loop

## Objectives
- [x] JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.
- [x] Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
- [x] Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
- [x] Application implements a for loop and works as expected.
All previous objectives have been met.
- [x] Project is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.
- [x] Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
- [] Practice styling with imagery and fonts
